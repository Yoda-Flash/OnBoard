# YOUR PROJECT NAME

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
A lightsaber ornament made for Hack Club's Hacky Holidays!

At first, I wanted to make a Yoda ornament PCB, but I realized that it would only look good with green colored lights. Upon further thought, I realized that Lightsabers would look good in nearly any color, which made it perfect as an ornament. Hence, I decided to make this lightsaber ornament PCB, which can change to whatever color the user chooses after altering one line of code, to bring joy to all Star Wars lovers during the holidays!

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
